          I was looking into
          <a href="https://nat.org" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-500">
            Nat Friedman's homepage
          </a>
          about 5 months ago and read a really obvious yet astonishing statement:
          <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900">A week is 2% of the year</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone knows that time is precious. But it's really not that tangible when you're stuck in the absolute scale of a clock. Instead, using relative scales is far more effective for humans, at least that is what I propose.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really fell in love with Nat's concept of "a week is 2% of the year" and have been adopting this to measure my life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl text-center mt-12 mb-10">
        Why use this?
      </h2>
      <div class="space-y-8 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">
        <p>
          Most people track time with clocks and calendars, but those don't really show how time is slipping away. Year Progress helps you visualize time in a way that makes it more tangible and motivating.
        </p>

        <p>Here's why it matters:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>See Time Differently – A week isn't just 7 days; it's 2% of your year. This perspective makes long-term planning easier.</li>
          <li>Stay Motivated – Watching your year, month, or day fill up in real-time can keep you on track with goals.</li>
          <li>Minimal & Effortless – No complex settings. Just open your menu bar and see where you are in the timeline.</li>
          <li>Better Than Existing Apps – Many apps charge high fees for simple progress tracking. This app keeps it affordable and effective.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you've ever felt like time slips away too fast, Year Progress will help you make sense of it—one progress bar at a time.
