## Background

I was looking into Nat Friedman's homepage about 5 months ago and read a really obvious yet astonishing statement: **A week is 2% of the year**.

Everyone knows that time is precious. But it's really not that tangible when you're stuck in the absolute scale of a clock. Instead, using relative scales is far more effective for humans, at least that is what I propose.

I really fell in love with Nat's concept of "a week is 2% of the year" and have been adopting this to measure my life.

## Why Use This?

Most people track time with clocks and calendars, but those don't really show how time is slipping away. Year Progress helps you visualize time in a way that makes it more tangible and motivating.

Here's why it matters:

- **See Time Differently** – A week isn't just 7 days; it's 2% of your year. This perspective makes long-term planning easier.
- **Stay Motivated** – Watching your year, month, or day fill up in real-time can keep you on track with goals.
- **Minimal & Effortless** – No complex settings. Just open your menu bar and see where you are in the timeline.
- **Better Than Existing Apps** – Many apps charge high fees for simple progress tracking. This app keeps it affordable and effective.

If you've ever felt like time slips away too fast, Year Progress will help you make sense of it—one progress bar at a time.
